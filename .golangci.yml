    ## enabled by default
    - errcheck # checking for unchecked errors, these unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases
    - gosimple # specializes in simplifying a code
    - govet # reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
    - ineffassign # detects when assignments to existing variables are not used
    - staticcheck # is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks
    - typecheck # like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code
    - unused # checks for unused constants, variables, functions and types

    ## disabled by default
    - bidichk # checks for dangerous unicode character sequences
    - bodyclose # checks whether HTTP response body is closed successfully
    - cyclop # checks function and package cyclomatic complexity
    - durationcheck # checks for two durations multiplied together
    - errname # checks that sentinel errors are prefixed with the Err and error types are suffixed with the Error
    - execinquery # checks query string in Query function which reads your Go src files and warning it finds
    - exhaustive # checks exhaustiveness of enum switch statements
    - gocognit # computes and checks the cognitive complexity of functions
    - gocyclo # computes and checks the cyclomatic complexity of functions
    - gomoddirectives # manages the use of 'replace', 'retract', and 'excludes' directives in go.mod
    - gomodguard # allow and block lists linter for direct Go module dependencies. This is different from depguard where there are different block types for example version constraints and module recommendations
    - goprintffuncname # checks that printf-like functions are named with f at the end
    - nakedret # finds naked returns in functions greater than a specified function length
    - nestif # reports deeply nested if statements
    - nilerr # finds the code that returns nil even if it checks that the error is not nil
    - noctx # finds sending http request without context.Context
    - nolintlint # reports ill-formed or insufficient nolint directives
    - nosprintfhostport # checks for misuse of Sprintf to construct a host with port in a URL
    - predeclared # finds code that shadows one of Go's predeclared identifiers
    - reassign # checks that package variables are not reassigned
    - rowserrcheck # checks whether Err of rows is checked successfully
    - sqlclosecheck # checks that sql.Rows and sql.Stmt are closed
    - tenv # detects using os.Setenv instead of t.Setenv since Go1.17
    - tparallel # detects inappropriate usage of t.Parallel() method in your Go test codes
    - unconvert # removes unnecessary type conversions
    - unparam # reports unused function parameters
    - usestdlibvars # detects the possibility to use variables/constants from the Go standard library
    - wastedassign # finds wasted assignment statements
    - whitespace # detects leading and trailing whitespace
