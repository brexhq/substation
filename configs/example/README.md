# example

These configs accompany the example pipeline in [build/terraform/aws/](build/terraform/aws/) and can be built by executing `sh build/config/compile.sh` from the project root. Each file includes comments that explains the impact of the config on each Substation app.

These example configs follow the best practices described in [configs/](configs/) -- each app deployed to the pipeline has a unique folder for its config(s).
