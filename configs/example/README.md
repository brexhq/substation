# example

These configs accompany the example pipeline in [build/terraform/aws](build/terraform/aws) and can be built by executing [build/config/compile.sh](build/config/compile.sh) from the project root. Each file includes comments that explains the impact of the config on each Substation app.

These example configs follow the best practices described in [configs/README.md](configs/README.md) -- each app deployed to the pipeline has a unique folder for its config(s).
