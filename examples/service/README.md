# service

This example is a toy implementation of Substation's gRPC service and shows how it can be used for inter-process communication (IPC) to send processed data from the sink back to the source. Refer to the [gRPC quickstart guide](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/#regenerate-grpc-code) for compiling the protobuf.
