# metrics

Contains interfaces and methods for generating application metrics and sending them to external services. Metrics can be generated anywhere in the application and optionally sent to a single external service. The naming convention for metrics names and attributes is PascalCase, also known as upper camel case (e.g. UpperCamelCase).

Information for each metrics generator is available in the [GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/brexhq/substation/v2/internal/metrics).
